## SensitivitySeq
SensitivitySeq integrates transcriptional treatment and disease signatures using deep learning to predict drug sensitivity to small molecule compounds and genetic dependency in cell line models of cancer. 

SensitivitySeq features pan-cancer deep neural network models capable of predicting cell line drug response outcomes using compound and cell line transcriptional signatures.
